Evie Pless is a computational biologist and data scientist with experience in a range of methodologies and biological systems. She grew up in the Bay Area, CA and studied biology at Stanford University. She joined the Powell Lab at Yale University for her doctoral research, where she investigated population and landscape genetics of the invasive disease vector mosquito Aedes aegypti.

Evie shifted to population genomics in humans for her postdoc at UC Davis with Dr. Brenna Henn and then joined a biotech startup developing a blood test for lung cancer based on genetic features from cell-free DNA. She is excited for her next chapter investigating chromatinopathies with the Horlbeck Lab!

In her free time, Evie enjoys reading, hiking, and exploring Providence with her family.
