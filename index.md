## Dissecting the architecture of chromatin regulation in human disease

We study **Chromatinopathies**, a large class of genetic disorders in which disruption in chromatin modifying machinery leads to developmental delay and intellectual disability. Using high-throughput genetic screening and epigenomic readouts, we seek to understand how chromatin regulation shapes cell fate decisions and identify paths to treatment for these disorders.

We are part of the Division of Genetics and Genomics at Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital and the Harvard Medical School Department of Genetics.
