# Dissecting the architecture of chromatin regulation in human disease

We study **Chromatinopathies**, a large class of genetic disorders in which disruption in chromatin modifying machinery leads to developmental delay and intellectual disability. Using high-throughput genetic screening and epigenomic readouts, we seek to understand how chromatin regulation shapes cell fate decisions and identify paths to treatment for these disorders.
